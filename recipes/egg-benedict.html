    <p>Eggs Benedict is a traditional American breakfast and brunch recipe that originated in New York City. It consists of an English muffin, cut in half, toasted, and topped with Canadian bacon, poached eggs, and classic French Hollandaise sauce. It's decadent, rich, and satisfying.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Toasted english muffin </li>
        <li>A slice or two of Canadian bacon</li>
        <li>A poached egg</li>
        <li>Hollandaise sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To poach an egg, first fill the pot with about 3 inches of water.  Bring the water to a boil and then reduce heat until it reaches a simmer. You should see small bubbles coming to the surface but not rolling.  Add a little splash of vinegar to the water (this is optional, but it helps the egg white to stay together once it is in the water).</li>
        <li>To make hollandaise sauce, start by melting butter in a saucepan.  Meanwhile, beat egg yolks in separate bowl and add lime juice, heavy cream, and salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Once the butter has melted, youâ€™re ready to temper the eggs by adding a small amount of the hot butter to the egg mixture.  Stir it well and repeat this process, slowly adding one spoonful of hot butter to the egg mixture.  We do this to avoid curdling the eggs.</li>
        <li>Finally, add the mixture back to the saucepan and cook it for a few more seconds.

            <p>Some people worry about raw eggs in their hollandaise sauce.  In this sauce, the eggs are cooked, they are just cooked very slowly to avoid curdling!  Cooking the hollandaise allows for a thicker, yummy sauce for your Eggs Benedict.</p></li>
